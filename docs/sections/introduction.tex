\section{Introduction} 

The main objective of this project is to implement a secure auction management system, using the principles of a Blockchain. This system, enables users to create and participate in auctions.

The blockchain-based auction management system we purpose, needs to follow 4 rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bid confidentiality, integrity and authentication
    \item Bid acceptance control and confirmation
    \item Bid author identity and anonymity
    \item Honesty assurance 
\end{itemize}
The rules stated before need to be complemented with security mechanisms that will allow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Confidentiality of all transactions;
    \item Privacy of the clients;
    \item Assurance of the identity validity of each agent (clients and servers);
    \item Secure transmission of all information between all agents;
    \item secure storage of all transactions without compromising private data or information.
\end{itemize}
This report presents and explains all the security measures we need to implement, to make the auction management system safe and confidential for all participants.
